# Web Applications Development. Laboratory 6 – “Mr. Burger – Three-tier”

Keeping up with the last development that you did to “Mr. Burger” online web
application, today is the moment to change the application to a Three-tier
approach.

1. You will have to create two php files; one for the Application Layer and
the second one for the Database Layer (Similar as we did in class
practice). You must make sure that all your previous services work with
the new approach. This includes modifying the ajax calls in the
Presentation Layer.

2. Start preparing your database for a further lab. The purpose is to be able
to save an order whenever a user places one. Some similar functionality
as in the comments section will be added before posting an order to the
Database. This section will be graded in the next laboratory, but you
might want to start building it up.

##Extra information to consider:
- You must use the AJAX jQuery techniques that we saw at class as well as
the PHP Service techniques to call the cookies and sessions.
- Follow instructions! The same instructions tell you what to be done.
- The way in which you design your functions, services, cookies and
sessions, and the way in which you give functionality to the site will be
graded! Extra details and features will be taken in consideration!
